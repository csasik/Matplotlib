## Matplotlib The Power of Plots

# Analysis of ride sharing data 

![Ride.png](Ride.png)

The dataset contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. Using this dataset I am building a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

Average Fare ($) Per City

Total Number of Rides Per City

Total Number of Drivers Per City
![Total_Drivers_City_Type.png](Total_Driders_City_Type.png)

City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

The pie charts represents:

% of Total Fares by City Type
% of Total Rides by City Type
% of Total Drivers by City Type
